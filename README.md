# General
This code is for project 2 of Brandeis COSI 149B Spring 2025. 

OpenManus code was provided by Jiarui Zhang, from this repository [here](https://github.com/JerryZhang4real/OpenManus). It was originally used in testing, but did not end up being used in the final project code in this repo.

t-patchGNN code was provided by Zepeng Hu, based on the original repository [here](https://github.com/usail-hkust/t-PatchGNN). The original inspiration for the langchain code/architecture used in `run_agent.py` also comes thanks to Zepeng Hu. Note that the `mimic.pt` file is not included in this repo currently because it is too large for storage in github.
